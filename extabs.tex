\textbf{The Idea: We have implemented a language for describing system
call sequences and proved its usefulness by using it in CrashSim}\break

Many instances of bugs, security problems and malicious activity are
visible in an application's system call activity.  We can take advantage of
this fact to identify these problems by identifying specific,
problematic system call sequences.  To do this, we need a way to describe
these sequences.  In this work we show that these sequences can be modeled
using finite automata with registers and offer a way to construct these
automata using {\tt RELANG}, a new domain specific
language similar to regular expressions with back
references.  To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach we
used {\tt RELANG} to describe the system call sequences used by
CrashSimulator's checkers and mutators.  CrashSimulator was able to
identify YYY previously-undiscovered bugs in major applications using
checkers and mutators written in {\tt RELANG}.  Additionally, we conducted a
user study that found {\tt RELANG} was both easier to learn and more
efficient to work with than CrashSimulator's previous Python-based checker
and mutator description strategy.
